abstract = {The paper presents the results of the numerical and physical experiments, aimed at assessing the influence of pulsed force of electromagnetic field on the melt motion and the fluid velocities. The experiment was performed on the eutectic alloy Galinstan in the cylindrical volume, where an ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter was employed for velocity measurements under conditions of pulsed and steady EM field application. A numerical simulation of the melt flow, forced by the steady EM force, involved a 2D axisymmetric model. The k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model was used to obtain the information about the melt velocities. The verification of the numerical model was carried out for the steady case. The effects of pulsed and steadily applied Lorentz force were compared using the physical experiment. An intensity of the velocity pulsations in Galinstan for the pulsed frequencies in the range from 0.05 to 1Hz considerably exceeded the values measured in the permanently stirred melt. For higher values of pulsed frequencies (from 1 to 10Hz) the effect decreases and only slightly differs from the influence of the permanently applied Lorentz force.},

These phenomena include turbulent flow in the nozzle and mold, the trans- port of bubbles and inclusion particles, multi-phase flow phenomena, the effect of electromagnetic forces, heat transfer, interfacial phenomena and interactions between the steel surface and the slag layers, the transport of solute elements and segregation.

Extensive grain refinement has been observed in both continuous casting and batch-type mold casting.

It can be used to analyze the distribution of the temperature filed and the flow filed in the centrifugal casting under the gravity, the electromagnetic stirring force and the centrifugal force. Some experiments were carried out to verify the above analysis results. The effects of the electromagnetic force on the centrifugal casting process are discussed. The results showed that under the 0.15 T electromagnetic field intensity, both the absolute pressure of metal flow to mold wall and the metal flow velocity on the same location have some differences between the electromagnetic centrifugal casting and the centrifugal casting. Numerical results for understanding the electromagnetic stirring of the centrifugal casting process have a guiding significance.},

abstract = {A new method for producing semisolid slurry, annular electromagnetic stirring (A-EMS), to refine and spheroidize grains was exploited. Experimental work was undertaken to investigate the effects of cooling rate, stirring power and stirring time on the solidification behavior of A357 alloy using A-EMS. It was found that increasing the cooling rate and stirring power gave rise to substantial grain refinement, which could be attributed to the increase of effective nucleation rate caused by the extremely uniform temperature and composition fields in the bulk liquid during the initial stage of solidification. Results showed that a fully grain refined spherical structure could be obtained using proper processing conditions within 10 s. ?? 2009 The Chinese Society for Metals.},
